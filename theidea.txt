Project Name: EchoWall – A Voice Without a Name

What is it?
EchoWall is an anonymous website where people can share their thoughts and struggles on 
different social topics like stress, anxiety, loneliness, or family pressure — without needing an account or name.

Why?
Many people feel alone or afraid to speak up. This platform gives them a safe space to express themselves and see 
that others feel the same.

Goal:
To break the silence around real social issues and help people feel understood, even by strangers.
 It’s simple, honest, and made to support mental health and connection in our generation.
